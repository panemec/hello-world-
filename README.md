# hello-world-
A place called home is where I say hello-world.  Thank you for welcoming me in this window of time!

Nemo has entered the house.  Who is Nemo?  Why me of course! I've been ushered into a new dimension by my alien friends, who think their funny btw. In any case, I landed my craft here, and I'm assured that this journey will yield yet another plank in my quest for knowledge, love, fulfillment and "the meaning of life".  I'm told I must speak HTML, CSS, Javascript, and more to communicate with those who reside in this realm.  So, let's not waste time!  I love to talk!
